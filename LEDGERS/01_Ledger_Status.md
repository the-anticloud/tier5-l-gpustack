## Independent verification

The chain is verifiable without trusting this project's tooling:

```
anticloud ledger verify
anticloud ledger export > ledger.jsonl
```

Each block carries the previous block's digest, so removing or reordering an
entry invalidates every block after it. That property is the reason the
ledger can stand in for a claim of what happened.
